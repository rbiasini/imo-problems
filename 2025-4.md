## Problem
A proper divisor of a positive integer N is a positive divisor of N other than N itself.
The infinite sequence a1, a2, . . . consists of positive integers, each of which has at least three proper
divisors. For each n â©¾ 1, the integer an+1 is the sum of the three largest proper divisors of an.
Determine all possible values of a1.

## Solution
First we will prove that a1 must be divisible by 2.
Let's assume that a1 is not divisble by 2 and let's say D1, D2 and D3 are the largest proper divisors of a1. Then: 

```
a2 = D1 + D2 + D3 <= a1 * (1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5) = a1 * 47/60 < a1
```

The above means that if a1 is not divisible by 2, then a2 will be strictly smaller than a1.
Moreover, if a1 is odd, then also a2 will be odd (sum of three odd numbers), so all the numbers in the sequence will be odd.
The sequence will then be strictly decreasing and therefore not infinite. We then conclude that a1 must be divisible by 2.


Next, we will prove that if a1 is divisible by 2, then it must be divisible by 3 as well.
Let's assume that a1 is not divisble by 3, with `D1 = a1/2`. Then: 

```
a2 = D1 + D2 + D3 <= a1 * (1/2 + 1/4 + 1/5) = a1 * 19/20 < a1
```

Once again, The above means that if a1 is not divisible by 3, then a2 will be strictly smaller than a1.
Now let's also prove that if a1 is divisible by 2, but not by 3, then none of the elements in the sequence can be divisible by 3.

Two cases:
  - a1 is divisible by 4, hence:

    ```
    a2 = a1/2 + a1/4 + D3 = 3*a1/4 + D3
    ```
    since D3 is not divible by 3, then a2 cannot be divible by 3 either and the sequence would strictly decrease.

  - a1 is not divisible by 4, hence:
    
    ```
    a2 = a1/2 + D2 + D3
    ```
    a1/2, D2, D3 are all odd numbers, therefore a2 would be odd and the sequence would strictly decrease.

We then conclude that a1 must be divible by both 2 and 3, hence D1 = "a1/2" and D2 = "a1/3"
